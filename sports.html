                <h2>‘Happening too often’: Bangladesh coach Cabrera on conceding late goals</h2>

                <p>Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera expressed deep frustration after his side once again conceded in stoppage time to draw 2-2 against Nepal in a FIFA international friendly at the National Stadium in Dhaka on Thursday night.

Leicester City midfielder Hamza Choudhury's brace had put Bangladesh on course for their first win over Nepal in five years, but the men in red and green were denied at the death as Ananta Tamang flicked in a corner to level the score.

"It's not a mental problem," Cabrera insisted after the match. "We've prepared to defend that action hundreds of times in training, but for whatever reason, it can happen. Still, it's true that it's happening too often."</p>

                <h2>Hamza scores from bicycle kick but Bangladesh draw 2-2 in Nepal friendly</h2>

                <p>Jaws dropped and hands landed on heads as Bangladesh star Hamza Choudhury produced a moment of sheer brilliance that left spectators breathless -- not only at the National Stadium but also in front of TV screens, bringing Bangladesh back into the game in their FIFA friendly against Nepal on Thursday. In a match that had offered little to cheer for the home side, the Leicester City midfielder delivered a one-man show, drawing Bangladesh level at 1-1 just a minute after the restart with an outrageous bicycle kick. Hamza then followed it up with an audacious Panenka penalty in the 50th minute to give the hosts a 2-1 lead, but ultimately, Bangladesh were deprived of their second win of the year when Nepal's Ananta Tamang silenced the stadium with an equaliser in the third minute of stoppage time. Earlier, Rohit Chand fired Nepal into the lead with a thunderous strike in the 29th minute. Photo: STAR</p>
